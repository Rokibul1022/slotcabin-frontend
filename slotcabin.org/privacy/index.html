                <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2024</p>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>At SlotCabin.org, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our social gaming platform. We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create an account, including your username, email address, and any other information you choose to provide.</p>

                <p>We also automatically collect certain information about your device and usage of our platform, including your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, and information about your interactions with our games and features. This helps us improve our services and provide a better gaming experience.</p>

                <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our social gaming platform. This includes processing your registration, managing your virtual coin balance, tracking your game progress and achievements, and displaying leaderboards and statistics. We may also use your information to communicate with you about your account, send you important updates about our services, and respond to your inquiries and support requests.</p>

                <p>Your information helps us personalize your gaming experience, recommend games that might interest you, and ensure the security and integrity of our platform. We may also use aggregated, non-personally identifiable information for analytics and research purposes to better understand how our users interact with our platform.</p>

                <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may share your information with trusted service providers who assist us in operating our platform, conducting our business, or serving our users, provided they agree to keep this information confidential.</p>

                <p>We may also disclose your information if required by law, to protect our rights or property, to enforce our Terms of Service, or in connection with a business transaction such as a merger or acquisition. In the event of such a transaction, we will notify you and ensure your information remains protected under this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>4. Data Security and Retention</h2>
                <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

                <p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide our services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time by contacting us at info@slotcabin.org.</p>

                <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
                <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal information. You can modify your account information through your profile settings or by contacting us directly. You may also opt out of certain communications from us, though some service-related communications may still be necessary for account management.</p>

                <p>If you are located in the European Union, you have additional rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including the right to data portability and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>

                <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
                <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience on our platform. These technologies help us remember your preferences, analyze site traffic, and improve our services. You can control cookie settings through your browser, though disabling cookies may affect the functionality of our platform.</p>

                <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or applicable laws. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy on our website and updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of our platform after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
